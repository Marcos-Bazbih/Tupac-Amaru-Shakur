                Tupac Amaru Shakur born Lesane Parish Crooks,
                June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), better known by his stage name 2Pac and by his alias Makaveli,
                was an American rapper, songwriter, and actor. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential rappers of all time.
                Much of Shakur's work has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities,
                and he has often been considered a symbol of activism against inequality.
                Shakur was born in Manhattan, a borough of New York City, but relocated to Baltimore, Maryland in 1984 and then the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988.
                He moved to Los Angeles in 1993 to further pursue his music career.
                By the time he released his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he had become a central figure in West Coast hip hop,
                introducing social issues to the genre at a time when gangsta rap was dominant in the mainstream. Shakur achieved
                further critical and commercial success with his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against the World (1995).
